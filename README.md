This game was inspired by childhood imagination, and the idea of fighting imaginary monsters. The game takes place in the woods, and the player uses a "wand" to banish the monsters attacking them in the forest. There are two types of monsters in the game, ground dwelling shelled monsters, and flying blob monsters. The shelled monsters will only try to reach the player when they are on the ground, while the others will follow wherever you go. Since the monsters are imaginary, they are able to walk through certain items, like trees, while the player will have to find other ways to navigate the scene.

The goal of the player is to destroy the monsters without losing all of their health. Each level has a goal of a different number of monsters destroyed, increasing each level to make the game more challenging.
